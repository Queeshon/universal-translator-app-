## TREK

<hr>

Trek is a unique messaging platform that allows users to talk with anyone, no matter what language they speak. Users can set their language to whatever they are most comfortable with, and any conversation they have with other users will translate itself into that set language. On the other side of the conversation, the other user will see the same conversation, only, it is translated into that user's language. Also, if users possess a microphone, they will be able to record a voice message, which will then be sent as a text message.

In development, we used Ruby on Rails to handle users and their messages and conversations. The translations were implemented using the Google Translate API, and the voice recording messages were implemented using the Google Cloud Speech-To-Text.
